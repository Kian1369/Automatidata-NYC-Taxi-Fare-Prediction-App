# AutomatiData: NYC Taxi Fare Estimator Project

## Overview

Welcome to the AutomatiData project! This project involves developing an application for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) that allows riders to estimate taxi fares in advance. The project is divided into six comprehensive parts, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning. 

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to create a robust model that predicts taxi fares and tipping behavior for NYC TLC riders. This is achieved by following a structured approach across six courses, each contributing to the final application.

## Part 1: Project Proposal

### Objective

- Develop a project proposal outlining milestones for the ride fare data project.

### Tasks

- Gather information from the last executive meeting.
- Assign PACE stages to the requested tasks.
- Organize tasks into milestones.
- Create a project proposal for executive approval.

### Deliverables

- A comprehensive project proposal defining the scope and milestones of the fare estimation app.

## Part 2: Data Understanding

### Objective

- Understand the data needed for the project.

### Tasks

- Identify the necessary datasets for the project.
- Understand the structure and components of the data.
- Explore the data to identify key variables and relationships.

### Deliverables

- Detailed analysis of the data structure and key variables.
- Initial insights and data understanding report.

## Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Objective

- Use exploratory data analysis to organize and understand the data.

### Tasks

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct EDA to identify patterns and anomalies.
- Visualize data to gain insights into taxi fare and tipping behavior.

### Deliverables

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
- EDA report with visualizations and key findings.

## Part 4: Statistical Testing

### Objective

- Conduct statistical testing within the project.

### Tasks

- Perform hypothesis testing to validate assumptions.
- Analyze statistical significance of key variables.
- Ensure the data meets necessary assumptions for modeling.

### Deliverables

- Hypothesis testing results and analysis.
- Statistical summary report validating data assumptions.

## Part 5: Regression Models

### Objective

- Build regression models using Python to predict taxi fares.

### Tasks

- Develop multiple regression models to predict fare amounts.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as R-squared and RMSE.
- Fine-tune models to improve accuracy.

### Deliverables

- Trained regression models.
- Model evaluation report with performance metrics.

## Part 6: Machine Learning Models

### Objective

- Build a machine learning model to predict tipping behavior.

### Tasks

- Develop machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict generous tippers.
- Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.
- Provide actionable insights based on model predictions.

### Deliverables

- Trained machine learning models.
- Model evaluation report with key insights.
- Recommendations for future improvements.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### Project Achievements

- Developed a comprehensive fare estimation and tipping prediction model for NYC TLC.
- Conducted detailed EDA and statistical testing to ensure data quality.
- Built and evaluated regression and machine learning models for accurate predictions.

### Business Impact

- The model can be used to estimate fares and predict tipping behavior, enhancing driver service strategies and rider satisfaction.
- Future improvements include collecting more granular data and refining models for higher accuracy.
