# Automatidata: NYC Taxi Fare Prediction App

## Note 

This project was one of the three main projects I completed while I was getting my **Google Advanced Data Analytics** certification. Therefore, the story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this project are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred. And, the data shared in this project has been created for pedagogical purposes.
