## Project Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

### Overview

The end-of-course project in Course 3 emphasizes the ability to use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to organize and understand the data within a project. In this project, I was tasked with assisting the Automatidata team in analyzing data provided by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) to gain insights into taxi ridership patterns and prepare the data for further modeling.

### Objectives

1. **Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Organize and clean the provided data.
    - Identify and handle outliers.
    - Determine the variables that have the largest impact on trip fares.
    - Filter the data to focus on the most relevant variables for regression analysis.

2. **Data Visualization**
    - Create visualizations using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
    - Develop a Tableau dashboard to visualize taxi/limo trips by month on a New York City map.
    - Ensure the visualizations are accessible and easy to understand, including considerations for individuals with visual impairments.

### Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
    - Assess the data to determine applicable columns.
    - Handle missing data and outliers.
    - Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the data distribution.

2. **Building Visualizations**
    - Create box plots to identify outliers.
    - Develop histograms to visualize data distributions.
    - Plot scatter plots to explore relationships between key variables such as trip distance and total fare amount.

3. **Evaluate and Share Results**
    - Summarize key findings from the EDA.
    - Present visualizations and insights in a clear and accessible manner.

### Key Insights

- **Outliers Identification:** Identified and recommended removing outliers with a recorded trip distance of 0, as these are anomalies that could skew fare predictions.
- **Variable Impact:** Analyzed the impact of various variables on trip fares, highlighting trip distance and total amount as key factors.
- **Data Filtering:** Filtered the dataset to focus on relevant variables, preparing it for regression and statistical analysis.

### Next Steps

- **Model Building:** I will use the cleaned and structured data to build a regression model for predicting taxi fares.
- **Further Analysis:** I will continue refining the data and visualizations to enhance model accuracy and insight clarity.

By completing this part of the project, I gained a solid foundation in conducting EDA, an essential skill for any data professional. The visualizations and insights derived from this analysis will be crucial in making data-driven decisions and advancing to the next phase of the project.
