# Automatidata Project

## Project Goal

In this fictional scenario, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has approached the data consulting firm Automatidata to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride.

## Background

Since 1971, TLC has been regulating and overseeing the licensing of New York City's taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.

## Scenario

You are a newly-hired data professional at Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm. Automatidata’s focus is to help clients transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions. In this scenario, you will consult with The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission to develop an app that will help users (TLC riders) estimate their taxi fares before their ride. Your first responsibility as a data analytics consultant will be to structure the necessary tasks into a project proposal that establishes milestones for the ride fare data project.

## Course 1: Project Proposal

### Overview

The first course focuses on gathering information, assigning PACE stages to tasks, organizing tasks into milestones, and creating a project proposal.

### Objectives

- Gather information from the notes from the last executive meeting of Automatidata.
- Assign PACE stages to the requested tasks.
- Organize tasks into milestones.
- Create a project proposal for the executive team’s approval.

### Project Proposal

- **Title:** Project Proposal for NYC TLC Fare Estimation App
- **PACE Stages:** Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute
- **Milestones:**
  1. Initial Research and Data Collection
  2. Data Analysis and Cleaning
  3. Model Development and Testing
  4. Final Model Deployment and App Development

## Course 2: Data Understanding

### Overview

The second course focuses on understanding the data needed for the project.

### Objectives

- Identify the relevant data sources.
- Understand the structure and quality of the data.
- Prepare the data for analysis and modeling.

### Data Understanding

- **Data Sources:** NYC TLC trip records, fare data, and additional external datasets.
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality.
- **Data Exploration:** Initial analysis to understand key features and their relationships.

## Course 3: Exploratory Data Analysis

### Overview

The third course focuses on using exploratory data analysis to organize and understand the data within the project.

### Objectives

- Perform descriptive statistics on the dataset.
- Visualize data distributions and relationships.
- Identify and handle outliers and missing values.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summary statistics for key features.
- **Data Visualization:** Histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identifying and handling anomalies in the data.
- **Missing Values:** Strategies for dealing with incomplete data.

## Course 4: Statistical Testing

### Overview

The fourth course focuses on conducting statistical testing within the project.

### Objectives

- Formulate hypotheses based on business questions.
- Perform statistical tests to validate hypotheses.
- Interpret the results to provide actionable insights.

### Statistical Testing

- **Hypothesis Formulation:** Defining null and alternative hypotheses.
- **Statistical Tests:** T-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA.
- **Results Interpretation:** Drawing conclusions from test outcomes.

## Course 5: Building Regression Models

### Overview

The fifth course focuses on building regression models using Python to predict taxi fares.

### Objectives

- Develop a multiple linear regression (MLR) model.
- Evaluate the model performance using various metrics.
- Ensure the model is generalizable and not overfit to the training data.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the model.

### Regression Models

- **Model Development:** Creating and training the MLR model.
- **Model Evaluation:** R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics.
- **Insights:** Feature importance and model implications.

## Course 6: Machine Learning Models

### Overview

The sixth course focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a NYC TLC taxi cab rider will be a generous tipper.

### Objectives

- Develop and compare machine learning models to predict generous tippers.
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the model's predictions.

### Machine Learning Model

- **Problem Definition:** Predicting generous tippers (≥ 20% tip).
- **Model Development:** Random Forest and XGBoost models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.
- **Insights and Recommendations:** Feature impact and future improvements.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building data-driven solutions for the NYC TLC. By following a structured methodology and leveraging various data analysis and machine learning techniques, we developed a robust fare estimation model and a predictive model for tipping behavior, providing valuable insights and recommendations for future improvements.
