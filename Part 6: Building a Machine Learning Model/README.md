## Project Part 6: Building a Machine Learning Model

### Overview

In Course 6, the focus is on building a machine learning model to predict whether a New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (NYC TLC) taxi cab rider will be a generous tipper. Automatidata was tasked with creating this model to help drivers anticipate tipping behavior and enhance their service strategies.

### Objectives

- Develop and compare machine learning models to predict generous tippers (â‰¥ 20% tip).
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics.
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the model's predictions.

### Project Tasks

#### Part 1: Problem Definition and Data Assumptions

- **Objective:** Define the problem and outline assumptions.
- **Tasks:**
  - Identify the problem: Predicting generous tippers among NYC TLC riders.
  - Assume key factors influencing tipping behavior (itinerary, fare amount, time of day).

#### Part 2: Model Development

- **Objective:** Build and evaluate machine learning models.
- **Tasks:**
  - Develop two different modeling architectures: Random Forest and XGBoost.
  - Train the models using the prepared dataset.
  - Compare model performance to identify the best model.

#### Part 3: Model Evaluation

- **Objective:** Assess the performance and reliability of the machine learning models.
- **Tasks:**
  - Compute key metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.
  - Analyze the results to determine the best-performing model.

#### Part 4: Insights and Recommendations

- **Objective:** Derive business insights and provide recommendations based on the model's findings.
- **Tasks:**
  - Summarize key insights from the model predictions.
  - Provide recommendations for additional data collection and future model improvements.
  - Suggest beta testing the model with taxi drivers for further feedback.

### Key Insights and Recommendations

- **Model Performance:** Both Random Forest and XGBoost models performed well, with Random Forest yielding slightly better predictions.
  - **F1 Score:** 0.7235
  - **Precision, Recall, Accuracy:** Reasonably strong across both models.
- **Feature Impact:** Itinerary, fare amount, and time of day were significant predictors of generous tipping behavior.
- **Data Recommendations:** Collect more granular driver and user-level data, including past tipping behavior, to improve model accuracy.
- **Business Impact:** The model can be used as an indicator of tip amount, helping drivers anticipate tipping behavior and adjust their service accordingly.

### PACE Framework

The project follows the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) framework to ensure a structured approach to problem-solving.

#### Plan

- **Research Question:** How can we predict generous tippers among NYC TLC riders?
- **Data Collection:** Gather data on trip itinerary, fare amount, time of day, and other relevant features.

#### Analyze and Construct

- **Model Development:** Build and tune Random Forest and XGBoost models.
- **Feature Selection:** Select features that significantly impact tipping behavior.

#### Execute

- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the models' performance and ensure they meet necessary assumptions.
- **Communicate Insights:** Present the model's predictions and business implications to stakeholders.

### Conclusion

The machine learning models developed in this project provide a robust framework for predicting generous tippers among NYC TLC riders. By leveraging these models, the NYC TLC can offer insights to taxi drivers, enhancing their service strategies and potentially increasing their earnings through better anticipation of tipping behavior. Future improvements include collecting more granular data and further model refinement.
