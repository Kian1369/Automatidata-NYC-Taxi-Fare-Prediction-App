# Automatidata: NYC Taxi Fare Prediction App

## Note 

This project was one of the three main projects I completed while I was getting my **Google Advanced Data Analytics** certification. Therefore, the story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this project are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred. And, the data shared in this project has been created for pedagogical purposes. 

## Project Overview

In this project, as a data professional at Automatidata, I collaborated with the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) to develop an app that estimates taxi fares for riders before their journey. This project aims to utilize the vast amount of data collected from the NYC area to create a predictive model for taxi fares.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to structure and execute a series of tasks that will culminate in the creation of an app for estimating taxi fares. This involves planning the project, understanding the data requirements, performing exploratory data analysis, conducting statistical testing, and building both regression and machine learning models.

## Course 1: Foundations of Data Science

### Project Proposal

#### Background

Since 1971, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has been responsible for regulating and overseeing the licensing of the city's taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. The TLC has approached Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm, to develop an app that will help users estimate taxi fares in advance.

#### Scenario

As a newly-hired data professional at Automatidata, my first task was to structure the necessary tasks into a project proposal that establishes milestones for the ride fare data project.

### Project Timeline

The estimated timeline for completing the milestones in this project is as follows:

- **Milestone 1:** 1-2 days
- **Milestone 2:** 2-3 weeks
- **Milestone 3:** 1 week
- **Milestone 4:** 1 week
- **Milestone 5:** 1-2 weeks

### Conclusion

This project proposal outlines the foundational steps required to transform raw data into a functional app for estimating NYC taxi fares. Each milestone is designed to build on the previous one, ensuring a structured and efficient workflow towards achieving the project's goal.
